# Introduction
This is the repository for the R scripts used in our paper "Situating Protests and Elections: A Spatial Approach on Turkey, 2002-2015".

# Usage
After uploading the df_agg.Rdata, the following scripts can be employed subsequently: 17 Models, Model Averaging, Field Measures, Plots

Our field analysis is heavily inspired by the code of Adam Slez here:  https://github.com/aslez/msb_socius_2016
